### Hi, Iâ€™m Fabio â€” a PhD candidate in Economics at the Universityâ€¯ofâ€¯Bonn  

My research sits at the intersection of **macroeconomics and finance**, where I build and solve heterogeneousâ€‘agent models to shed light on distributional dynamics and aggregate fluctuations.

### ðŸ”¬â€¯What I do
- Develop rich heterogeneousâ€‘agent models with different layers of heterogeneity  
- Solve these models using **global solution methods**, **stateâ€‘space approaches**, **sequenceâ€‘space methods**, and **machineâ€‘learningâ€‘accelerated frameworks**

### ðŸš€â€¯Projects & Papers
Youâ€™ll find code for my ongoing projects in this repository list. A broader, regularly updated overview lives on my [personal website](https://fabio-stohler.github.io/).

### ðŸ“«â€¯Letâ€™s connect
Feel free to reach out at **fabio(dot)stohler(at)uniâ€‘bonn(dot)de** â€” Iâ€™m always happy to discuss macroâ€‘finance, computational methods, and potential collaborations!
