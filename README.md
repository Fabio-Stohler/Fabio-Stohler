I am a PhD student at the University of Bonn. My research focuses on the intersection of macroeconomics and finance. Within my projects, I solve heterogeneous agent models with varying degrees of heterogeneityâ€”globally, in state-space, in sequence space, and using machine learning techniques.

If you want to have a chat about the best ways to solve heterogeneous agent models, drop me an email at fabio(dot)stohler(at)uni-bonn(dot)de, visit my [personal website](https://fabio-stohler.github.io/), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/fabiostohler).
